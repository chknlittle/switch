# TODO

- [ ] Keep typing indicator active during tool calls - currently the typing indication stops when tool call messages are pushed to the server, then resumes after. Tool calls are still "thinking" churn and should be covered by the typing indicator.
- [ ] Use a local model to generate session slugs - make them more semantic instead of the current approach
